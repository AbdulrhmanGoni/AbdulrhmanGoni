# Hello 👋 I'm Abdulrhman Goni

**Full-Stack web developer with a focus on back-end**

I mainly work with **JavaScript/TypeScript**, and recently started exploring **Go** lang.<br/>
I build web servers, apps, APIs and developer tools.<br/>
I don’t believe in sticking to one language or technology forever,<br/>
Driven by curiosity, I enjoy exploring and learning new tools, languages, ideas, and approaches.<br/>
Always ready to adopt new tech stacks whenever the problems I am trying to solve require it.

# 💻 Tech Stack:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I don’t claim to have mastered everything I’m about to mention here. But I can
> say that I’ve learned and used them enough to be able to confidently participate in projects 
> involving them or any other related technologies that share similar fundamentals and concepts.
